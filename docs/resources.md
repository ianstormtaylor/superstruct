# Resources

A few resources that are helpful for building with Superstruct.

## Libraries

- [micro-superstruct](https://github.com/brandon93s/micro-superstruct) allows you to easily validate your [Micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro) API request body and query string parameters using Superstruct.

## Showcase

- [`bumpover`](https://github.com/doodlewind/bumpover) helps you transform data asynchronously with simple rules, whose validation API is built with Superstruct.
