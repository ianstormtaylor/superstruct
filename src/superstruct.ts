/**
 * `Superstruct` factories create different kinds of [[Struct]] validators, and
 * encapsulate the user-defined data types.
 *
 * The [[struct]] export is a factory that ships with Superstruct by default,
 * pre-configured with all of the built-in JavaScript data types. It's the
 * easiest way to quickly define structs:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { struct } from 'superstruct'
 *
 * const User = struct({
 *   id: 'number',
 *   name: 'string',
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * If you need to define custom data types, you can define your own by using
 * the [[superstruct]] export:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { superstruct } from 'superstruct'
 * import isEmail from 'is-email'
 * import isUrl from 'is-url'
 *
 * const struct = superstruct({
 *   types: {
 *     email: value => isEmail(value) && value.length < 256,
 *     url: value => isUrl(value) && value.length < 2048,
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * const User = struct({
 *   id: 'number',
 *   name: 'string',
 *   email: 'email',
 *   website: 'url?',
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * This way you can easily define structs that contain types like `'email'`,
 * `'url'`, or whatever else your application may need.

export interface Superstruct {
  /**
   * Structs are defined by passing a schema definition to the struct factory.
   * The schema definition can be a string, array, object or function. They can
   * also be composed by nesting structs inside each other.
   *
   * The default struct factory allows you to write structs using a shorthand
   * syntax for the most common casesâ€”arrays, objects, scalars, tuples, etc.
   *
   * ```js
   * struct('string') // Scalars
   * struct(['number']) // Arrays
   * struct({ name: 'string' }) // Objects
   * struct(['error', 'string']) // Tuples
   * struct('number?') // Optional
   * struct('string & email') // Intersection
   * struct('number | string') // Union
   * struct(value => true || false) // Function
   * struct(Struct) // Pass-through
   * ```
   *
   * Each shorthand is equivalent to a method on the [[Superstruct]] factory:
   *
   * ```js
   * // These are equivalent...
   * struct(['number'])
   * struct.array(['number'])
   *
   * struct('string & email')
   * struct.union(['string', 'email'])
   * ```
   *
   * And each one can use your custom types, or even other structs:
   *
   * ```js
   * struct('email')
   * struct(User)
   * ```
   *
   * The second argument to struct factories is always a `defaults` value. It
   * can either be the default itself or a function that returns the default.
   *
   * ```js
   * struct('id', uuid.v4)
   *
   * struct({
   *   id: 'number',
   *   name: 'string',
   *   is_admin: 'boolean?',
   * }, {
   *   is_admin: false,
