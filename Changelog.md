# Changelog

This document maintains a list of changes to the `superstruct` package with each new version. Until `1.0.0` is released, breaking changes will be added as minor version bumps, and smaller changes and fixes won't be detailed.

### `0.8.0` — October 8, 2019

###### BREAKING

**Several structs have been renamed!** Superstruct tries to mimic established naming schemes whenever possible for its API, and TypeScript is one of our main comparisons. To make things easier for people, we've renamed a few structs to more closely match their TypeScript counterparts:

- The `list` struct is now called `array`.
- The `partial` struct is now called `pick`.
- The `dict` struct is now called `record`.

Hopefully this will make them easier to understand at a glance!

**The `enums` struct has been removed!** This was special-cased in the API previously, but you can get the exact same behavior by creating an using the `array` and `enum` structs:

```js
struct.array(struct.enum(['red', 'blue', 'green']))
```

**The `any` struct has been removed! (Not the scalar though.)** Previously `struct.any()` was exposed that did the same thing as `struct()`, allowing you to use shorthands for common structs. But this was confusingly named because it has nothing to do with the `'any'` scalar type. And since it was redundant it has been removed.

**The `interface` struct now returns the original, unaltered value!** In an effort to make things more familiar, the `interface` struct now always returns the object that it is called with when it passes validation. So if the object was a function, a function will be returned. This makes it match more closely with the idea of "structural typing" that TypeScript and other typing systems are based on. \_If you want the old behavior, use the `pick` struct.

**Computed values function signatures have changed!** Previously a computed value would be called with a signature of `(value, root)` in some cases and `(value, parent)` in others. This was confusing, and the cause for the inconsistency was complex. This logic has been simplified, and now computed values are called with `(value, branch, path)` in all cases.

```js
struct.dynamic((value, branch, path) => {
  value === branch[branch.length - 1] // you can get the value...
  const parent = branch[branch.length - 2] // ...and the parent...
  const key = path[path.length - 1] // ...and the key...
  value === parent[key]
  const root = branch[0] // ...and the root!
})
```

The `path` is an array of keys representing the nested value's location in the root value. And the `branch` is an array of all of the sub values along the path to get to the current one. This allows you to always be able to receive both the **parent** and the **root** values from any location—as well as any value in between.

**The `error.errors` property has been renamed `error.failures`, and isn't cyclical.** It being cyclical caused lots of issues whenever an `StructError` object was attempted to be serialized. And the `errors` property was slightly confusing because the elements of the array weren't full error objects. The new structure is easier to understand and work with.

**The `error.reason` property is no longer special-cased.** Previously you could return a "reason" string from validator functions and it would be added to error objects. However, now you must return an error properties object (with a `reason` property if you'd like), and all of the properties will be added to the error object. This makes Superstruct even more flexible as far as custom error details go.

**The `type` property of structs have been rewritten to be more clear.** This is an implementation mostly, but the `struct.type` string which shows up in error messages have been tweaked to be slightly more clear exactly what type they are checking for.

###### NEW

**Superstruct is now written in TypeScript.** It was rewritten from the ground up to make use of types, and to have better inline documented if you use a TypeScript-compatible IDE. There are probably improvements that can be made, so if you'd like to contribute please do!

**A new `partial` struct mimics TypeScript's `Partial` utility.** The new struct validates that its input partially matches an object defined as a set of properties with associated types. All of the properties of the object are optional.

**A new `size` struct allows validating array and string lengths.** The new struct validates that its input has a certain size, by checking its `length` property. This works strings or arrays.

**You can now provide a custom `Error` setting.** By passing in your own constructor when configuring Superstruct you can have complete control over the exact errors that are generated by structs that fail validation.

### `0.7.0` — September 21, 2019

###### BREAKING

- **The build process now outputs ES5 code.** Previously it was outputting ES6 code, which posed problems for some builders. This change shouldn't really affect anyone negatively, but it's being released as a breaking version just in case.

---

### `0.6.0` — September 13, 2018

###### BREAKING

- **Invalid `Date` objects are now considered invalid.** Previously using the built-in `'date'` validator would only check that the object was a `Date` instance, and not that it was a valid one. This has been fixed, and although it is technically a breaking change, most everyone would have expected this behavior to begin with.

---

### `0.5.0` — December 21, 2017

###### BREAKING

- **Validators must now return `true`, `false` or an error reason string.** Previously any truthy value would be considered valid. Now you can provide more information for the thrown errors by providing a string which will be attached as `error.reason`. However, this means that truthy string values now equate to invalid, not valid.

- **Property validators now receive `data` as their second argument.** Previously you only had access to the property `value`, but now you also have access to the entire object's `data`.

###### NEW

- **Errors can now contain reason information.** Validator functions can now return string instead of a boolean, denoting the reason a value was invalid. This can then be used to create more helpful error messages.

---

### `0.4.0` — December 1, 2017

###### BREAKING

- **`object` structs are no longer optional-ish.** Previously object struct types would not throw if `undefined` was passed and no properties were required. This was not only confusing, but complex to maintain. Now if you want an object struct to be optional, use the `struct.optional(...)` helper.

- **Removed the `Struct.default` method.** If you need to get the default value, use the `Struct.validate` or `Struct.assert` methods's return value instead.

###### NEW

- **Added the `dict`, `enum`, `intersection`, `union` and `tuple` structs.** These are all available as `struct.dict`, `struct.enum`, etc.

---

### `0.3.0` — November 30, 2017

###### BREAKING

- **The `validate()` method now returns `[ error, result ]`.** Previously it only had a single return value, which necessitated extra type checking to see if the value was an error or a result. Now you can just destructure the array to get either return value, for easier coding.

- **Errors have been simplified, removing "codes".** Previously there were multiple types of errors that were thrown and you could differentiate between them with the `error.code` property. But the other properties of the error already let you infer the code, so having multiple types of errors made for a larger API surface without much benefit.

---

### `0.2.0` — November 30, 2017

###### BREAKING

- **Structs are now functions again.** :smile: They are built on the same underlying schema classes underneath though, since that helps the code structure. But to allow for the `struct = Struct({ ... })` syntax the structs themselves have changed to be function.

###### NEW

- **The basic case is now `Struct(data)`.** Previously you had to use `Struct.assert(data)`. Although the `assert` method (and others) are still there, the basic case is a bit terser and more similar to the struct-initializing APIs in other languages.

---

### `0.1.0` — November 29, 2017

###### BREAKING

- **Structs are now classes instead of functions.** This is better in terms of the API being a bit less magic-y. It's also useful so that we can add other helpful methods to structs besides the `assert` method. What was previously `struct(data)` is now `struct.assert(data)`.

### `0.0.0` — November 24, 2017
